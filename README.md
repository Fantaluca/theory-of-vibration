This project implements a Finite Element Analysis (FEM) of a three-dimensional structure using Python

## Key Features


1. **Structure Modeling**
   - Creation of a complex 3D geometry with beam elements
   - Support for various boundary conditions (clamped nodes)
   - Addition of lumped masses on specific nodes
